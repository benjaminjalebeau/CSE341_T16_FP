## A few quick notes
- This project is currently setup to run on localhost:3000
- Render is not currently set up
- OAuth application id and secrets have not been set up for collaborators - I'm not sure how using my personal github id/secret will work when you try them.

## Setup
- npm install
- node swagger.js
- npm start
- note: package.json should have all needed packages for this project, if something is missing or you want to use something else, feel free to add to it.
